Ridwan is a young, enterprising, enthusiastic quality assurance, technical support expert. I have over the years worked from the bottom rank to a mid-class to professional support expert. Now looking for challenging roles in Quality Assurance (Manual testing and Automation testing).

I am familiar with collaboration tools (G-suite packages, JIRA Trello board), writing detail manual test cases, bug hunting, automation tests with IntelliJ using Java, API testing using Postman amongst the rest.

I have a knack for technology and has at all time stayed abreast with the latest technology. Over the years my colleagues do refer to me as a "One-stop expert" who is always ready to get issues resolved and will not stop troubleshooting until all users or enterprise issues are resolved.

My love for processes makes me outstanding, as I ensure to know every process end-to-end as to provide accurate responses on every escalated issue.

I possess and demonstrate the ability to work with little or no supervision and provide results within the expected delivery target.

I worked with Unified Payment Services Limited, where my responsibilities amongst others include Quality Assurance, Merchant support, Technical support, Database administration, SQL Query scripting, Automation, and Manual Testing.

I am looking for opportunities in the field of Software Testing, Quality Assurance or Technical support job role. I am certain I will be a plus to any team that I work with.
